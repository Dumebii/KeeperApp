# Project Overview âš¡âš¡âš¡:

This is an app that helps you take various notes, with a note title, and a note body. 

## Problem statement ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²: 

Build an app that helps people keep track of their thoughts or activities forthe day, or journal their ideas.

## I built this with:

THis project is primarily a React project, built on CodeSandBox. 

### Other external dependencies include:

Material UI

Google Fonts

## Learning curve ðŸ› ðŸ› :

With this project, I really got to undrstnd React states very well, having used state multiple times in my project. 

I also got to really understand the spread operator, and the concept of destructuring very well. 

Had to get around to using the map method for arrays, and also the filter method, in order to acieve optimum rendering. 
The filter method was employed to properly create the delete button. 

###
Just realised that I haven't ever really bothered to change the faveicons for any of my react apps. Opps! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª
